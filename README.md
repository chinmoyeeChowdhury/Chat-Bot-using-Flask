# Chat-Bot-using-Flask
The chatbot is trained with a set of training data present in /data directory. When the users inputs a query the bot searches for a response from the database if it finds an answer then it provides an appropriate response. 

## Local Setup:
 1. Ensure that Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and ChatterBot are installed (either manually, or run `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
 2. Run *app.py* with `python app.py`.
 3. The demo will be live at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

## How do I deploy this to a web server?
If you do not have a dedicated server, I highly recommend using [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/deploy-python-application/) or [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction) to host your application.
